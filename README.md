# Stoicism website
This repository contains an HTML/CSS website dedicated to Stoic philosophy. It features content on core Stoic principles, quotes from prominent Stoic thinkers, and guidance on applying Stoic wisdom in everyday life. The project is structured with a responsive design and clean UI to provide a seamless browsing experience across devices.

## The website uses the following technologies:

### HTML
Provides the structure and content layout for the website, including sections for navigation, historical information, Stoic disciplines, and Stoic techniques.
### CSS
Controls the styling and appearance of the website. 
  - The stylesheet (style.css) manages layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness, ensuring the site is visually appealing across various devices.
  - CSS media queries (@media rules) are used to adjust the layout, menu, and image sizes according to the screen size, making the site compatible with mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.
### JavaScript
Adds interactivity. 
  - It handles menu toggling on smaller screens and changes the bird image at the bottom of the page when the user scrolls to the bottom. 
  - The throttle function is used for optimizing the scroll event handling to reduce performance overhead.
  - Interactive Bird Animation:
The "bird" section utilizes JavaScript to change the bird's image when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page. Two bird images (bird_up.png and bird_down.png) are swapped dynamically based on the scroll position.


### FontAwesome
Provides icons for social links and enhance the visual design of the navigation bar.
